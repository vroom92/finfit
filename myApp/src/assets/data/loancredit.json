    "description": "Fixed interest rate loans are loans in which the interest rate charged on the loan will remain fixed for that loan's entire term, no matter what market interest rates do. A variable interest rate loan is a loan in which the interest rate charged on the outstanding balance varies as market interest rates change. As a result, your payments will vary as well."

Fifteen-year mortgages do charge lower interest rates than 30-year loans but carry higher monthly payments because you have to pay all principal back in half the time."
